# A Comparison of Embeddable Scripting Languages

A comparison of the performance and feature set of the embeddable scripting languages [gluon](https://github.com/gluon-lang/gluon) and [Rhai(Script)](https://github.com/rhaiscript/rhai).

## Evaluation Proposal

> In the context of embeddable scripting languages, I want to compare the performance and feature set of gluon (https://github.com/gluon-lang/gluon) and RhaiScript (https://github.com/rhaiscript/rhai) by building a CLI application, that can execute scripts in the two languages assubcommands and which then measures the runtime of the command. Multiple scripts will also evaluate the features of the languages, like JSONsupport, filesystem access, etc.
